This repository contains a PHP example demonstrating a common bug in recursive object comparison: failure to handle circular references.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file offers a solution to address the circular reference issue.  This is a crucial consideration when comparing complex object structures to avoid infinite loops and stack overflows. The solution uses a `visited` set to track already visited objects and prevents infinite recursion when dealing with circular references.
